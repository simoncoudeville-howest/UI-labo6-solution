                                As we refine our methods of responsive web design,* we’ve increasingly focus*ed on measure
                                (another word for “line length”) and its relationship to how people read. The popularization of
                                the “ideal measure” has led to advice such as “Increase font size for large screens and reduce
                                font size for small screens.” While a good measure does improve the reading experience, it’s
                                only one rule for good typography. Another rule is to maintain a comfortable font size.

                                In 2006, the <a href="https://www.nngroup.com/">Nielsen Norman group</a> released images of heat
                                maps from eye-tracking studies. The areas where people looked at the most while reading are red,
                                areas with fewer views are yellow, and the least-viewed areas are blue. As you can see below,
                                the red and yellow areas form three variations of an F-shaped pattern. These variations aren’t
                                surprising because people read in three different ways.

                                — how the F-shaped patterns are formed. We know that people. Don’t. Read. Each. Individual.

                                Typographers have been writing about the relationship between horizontal and vertical eye motion
                                for almost a century. In 1928, Jan Tschichold dismissed centered text and advocated for
                                left-aligned text. He argued that this would assist readers by providing a consistent left
                                (vertical) edge for the eye to return to after finishing each (horizontal) line.
